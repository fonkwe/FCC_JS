// Problem: Sum of integers in string

//Description:
//Your task in this kata is to implement a function that calculates the sum of the integers inside a string. 
//For example, in the string "The30quick20brown10f0x1203jumps914ov3r1349the102l4zy dog", 
//the sum of the integers is 3635.
//Note: only positive integers will be tested.

// Steps:








//test
    console.log("12.4"); //16
    console.log("h3ll0w0rld"); //3
    console.log("2 + 3 = ");  //5
    console.log("Our company made approximately 1 million in gross revenue last quarter.") //1
    console.log("The Great Depression lasted from 1929 to 1939."); //3868
    console.log("Dogs are our best friends."); //0
    console.log("C4t5 are 4m4z1ng."); //18
    console.log("The30quick20brown10f0x1203jumps914ov3r1349the102l4zy dog");   //3635
